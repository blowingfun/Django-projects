# Django-projects
This is my first django website, I have not yet deployed the website and it can only work on a local server. It is a simple to-do list website that will prompt users to create an account in order to gain access to the features. 
Using django, I was able to create the front end with html and css, as well as create the back end using SQLite3. 
Django handles most of the communication done between the back-end and front-end making the process of creating this website much easier.
